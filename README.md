# crime_stats
Packages Used:

-Pandas

-Selenium

-Beautiful Soup

Situation:  This program was developed in conjunction with the Zillow Real Estate project.  After creating the Zillow program, which mapped out real estate pricing information by region and placed it on a Google Map, I created this program in order to scrape crime statistics for the area.  

Outcome: This program scrapes individual crime reports (stored in .pdf format) from http://p2c.wilmingtonnc.gov/Summary_Disclaimer.aspx and calculates crime types and rates for any address within the region. Again, this product has served as an important "value added" for the real estate agent for whom I developed this program.
